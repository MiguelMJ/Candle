     * implementations, @ref RadialLight and @ref DirectedLight, is whether
     * the constant is the origin or the direction of the rays.

     * . This is convenient to manipulate color of the light (interpreted as 
     * the RGB value) and intensity (interpreted as the alpha value) 
     * separately.
     * 
     * By default, they use a sf::BlendAdd mode. This means that you can
     * specify any other blend mode you want, except sf::BlendAlpha, that
     * will be changed to the additive mode.
